# CSSOnlySite
A CSS Only Portfolio sample page

## Overview
This is a CSS Only page to show the scope and capabilities of CSS, understand what can be done without JavaScript, though the first option, in most cases, is the last. 

### Menu
A menu triggers setting an active status by making use of the `:target` pseudo-class. 

### Tabs
A CSS-only tabs section is implemented by playing with the `:target` pseudo-class as well as positions. A combination of selectors allows us to set a default tab which is displayed when the page loads. 

## Notes
Keep in mind this is a sample page for showing purposes only. JavaScript will continue to be our option to enhance the user experience.
